##Use Case: Return Radar in Action

## Meet Sarah - Product Manager at a Growing Startup

Sarah uses Pulse to manage three major initiatives:
- **Product Launch** (beta release in 2 weeks)
- **Q1 Planning** (strategic roadmap)
- **Mobile App Redesign** (ongoing UX improvements)

---

## The Scenario

**Monday, Nov 18**: Sarah is deep in Product Launch mode. She's:
- Reviewing landing page copy
- Coordinating with the design team
- Scheduling beta user interviews
- Last activity in Pulse: Adding notes from design review meeting

**Tuesday-Friday, Nov 19-22**: **Unexpected pivot** - a critical customer issue requires her full attention. She:
- Completely shifts focus to customer crisis management
- Doesn't open Pulse for 4 days
- Product Launch work goes dormant
- Meanwhile, her colleague Sarah Chen emails: "Need your input on the beta timeline"

**Monday, Nov 25**: Crisis resolved. Sarah opens Pulse.

## Without Return Radar

Sarah opens Pulse and sees:
- 47 total todos across all projects
- 12 calendar events this week
- 8 recent notes

**Her reaction**: *"Okay... what was I doing last week? What's urgent? Let me scroll through everything..."*

**Time spent**: 25 minutes re-orienting herself
- Checking each project manually
- Re-reading notes from last week
- Cross-referencing calendar with todos
- Realizing Sarah Chen's email about beta timeline

**Result**: Feels overwhelmed, misses that Product Launch has 2 overdue tasks
